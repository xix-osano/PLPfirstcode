     <h2>Here’s a tribute to Mandela's life and impact:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><p>Born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in South Africa's Eastern Cape</p></li>
       <li><p>Mandela dedicated his life to dismantling apartheid, the institutionalized racial segregation in South Africa. He became a prominent figure in the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1940s, pushing for non-violent resistance.</p></li>
       <li><p>As the government cracked down on the anti-apartheid movement, Mandela co-founded the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), in 1961.</p></li>
       <li><p>Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for his role in the fight against apartheid. For 27 years, he remained behind bars, becoming a beacon of hope and resilience for those fighting injustice worldwide.</p></li>
       <li><p>Mandela’s release from prison in 1990 marked a turning point not only for South Africa but for the world.</p></li>
       <li><p>In 1994, Mandela became South Africa’s first black president. His leadership was characterized by a commitment to nation-building and reconciliation, particularly through the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p></li>
       <li><p>His work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, alongside then-President F.W. de Klerk.</p></li>
       <li><p>He died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 67.</p></li>
       </ul>
